Perfect! What you’ve outlined is the **classic workflow for pushing a local image to the OpenShift internal registry** and redeploying it. Let me summarize and clarify it step by step so it’s easier to follow and avoid any common mistakes:

---

### **Step 1️⃣: Log in to OpenShift Internal Registry**

1. Get your internal registry URL:

```bash
oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry
```

* Usually looks like:
  `default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.<cluster-domain>`

2. Log in from your local Docker/Podman:

```bash
docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) <registry-url>
```

* `oc whoami -t` automatically generates your OpenShift token.
* Now your Docker can push images to OpenShift.

---

### **Step 2️⃣: Tag Your Local Image for OpenShift**

* Suppose your local image is built as:

```bash
docker build -t nginx-app:updated .
```

* Tag it for the OpenShift registry:

```bash
docker tag nginx-app:updated <registry-url>/<project>/<image-name>:<tag>
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker tag nginx-app:updated default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.ocp.example.com/myproject/nginx-app:v2
```

* `<project>` → your OpenShift namespace/project
* `<tag>` → version, e.g., `v2`

---

### **Step 3️⃣: Push the Image**

```bash
docker push <registry-url>/<project>/<image-name>:<tag>
```

* This stores your image in OpenShift’s internal registry.

---

### **Step 4️⃣: Update Your Deployment**

* Tell your deployment to use the new image:

```bash
oc set image deployment/<deployment-name> nginx=<registry-url>/<project>/<image-name>:<tag>
```

* Check rollout status:

```bash
oc rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>
oc get pods
```

* Your Nginx app should now run with the updated image and configuration.

---

✅ **Tip:**

* Use **version tags** (`v2`, `v2.1`, etc.) instead of `latest` to avoid confusion.
* Ensure your project/namespace exists in OpenShift:

```bash
oc project myproject
```

---

If you want, I can also show you how to **skip the local Docker build entirely** and do the **build directly inside OpenShift**, so you don’t need Docker on your laptop at all. This is usually cleaner for OCP workflows.

Do you want me to show that method?
