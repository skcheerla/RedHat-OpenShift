Ah! Got it — you want the **complete workflow including updating the Dockerfile and Nginx configuration** before building a new image for OpenShift. Here’s a clear step-by-step guide:

---

## **Step 0: Prepare Your Project Directory**

Make sure you have a project folder with:

```
/nginx-app
    ├─ Dockerfile
    ├─ nginx.conf       # your custom Nginx config
    └─ html/            # optional static files
```

---

## **Step 1: Update Your Dockerfile**

A typical Nginx Dockerfile might look like this:

```dockerfile
# Use official Nginx base image
FROM nginx:latest

# Copy your custom Nginx configuration
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Copy your web content
COPY html /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80
```

✅ **Make sure:**

* `nginx.conf` has the changes you want.
* The paths in `COPY` commands match your folder structure.

---

## **Step 2: Build the Image Locally**

From your project directory:

```bash
docker build -t nginx-app:updated .
```

* This creates a local image with your new configuration.
* Verify it works locally (optional):

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx-app:updated
```

* Open `http://localhost:8080` to test.

---

## **Step 3: Tag the Image for OpenShift Registry**

1. Get your OpenShift registry URL:

```bash
oc get route default-route -n openshift-image-registry
```

2. Log in from Docker:

```bash
docker login -u $(oc whoami) -p $(oc whoami -t) <registry-url>
```

3. Tag the image:

```bash
docker tag nginx-app:updated <registry-url>/<project>/<image-name>:v2
```

**Example:**

```bash
docker tag nginx-app:updated default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.ocp.example.com/myproject/nginx-app:v2
```

---

## **Step 4: Push the Image to OpenShift Registry**

```bash
docker push <registry-url>/<project>/<image-name>:v2
```

* This stores your new image inside OpenShift.

---

## **Step 5: Update Deployment to Use New Image**

```bash
oc set image deployment/<deployment-name> nginx=<registry-url>/<project>/<image-name>:v2
oc rollout status deployment/<deployment-name>
oc get pods
```

* OpenShift will redeploy pods with the new image and your updated Nginx configuration.

---

✅ **Extra Tip:**

* Use version tags (`v2`, `v2.1`, …) instead of `latest` for safer rollbacks.
* If you want **OCP to build the image directly**, you can create a BuildConfig and avoid local Docker entirely.

---

I can also create a **ready-to-use Dockerfile + folder structure + OpenShift commands** for your Nginx app so you can rebuild and deploy in **one go** inside OCP.

Do you want me to do that?
