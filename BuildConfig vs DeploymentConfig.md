Absolutely! Let’s break this **clearly**, because many people confuse **BuildConfig** and **DeploymentConfig** in OpenShift.

## **1. BuildConfig vs DeploymentConfig**

| Feature          | BuildConfig (BC)                                                                                                                       | DeploymentConfig (DC)                                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**      | Defines how an image is **built** (source code → container image).                                                                     | Defines how a container image is **deployed** as pods in OpenShift.                                  |
| **Triggered by** | Code changes, webhook from Git, manual `oc start-build`, or ImageStream changes.                                                       | ImageStream changes (ImageChange trigger), config changes (ConfigChange trigger), or manual rollout. |
| **Output**       | Produces an **image** stored in the internal OpenShift registry or external registry.                                                  | Produces **running pods**/replicas from an image.                                                    |
| **Lifecycle**    | Build runs, finishes, image is stored.                                                                                                 | Deployment runs, pods are created, old pods may be scaled down.                                      |
| **Frequency**    | Each build is a **one-time process** (can trigger multiple builds).                                                                    | Deployment can happen multiple times for the same image.                                             |
| **Example**      | BuildConfig pulls code from GitHub, builds Docker image, pushes to `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/namespace/myapp`. | DeploymentConfig uses that image to create 3 pods running the app.                                   |

## **2. Can we see both for each app?**

* **Yes, if the app was built inside OpenShift using a BuildConfig** (source-to-image or Dockerfile).
* **No, if the app was deployed directly from an external image** (e.g., `quay.io/myuser/myapp:latest`).

  * In that case, there is **only a DeploymentConfig** and **ImageStream** (optional) pointing to the external image.

### **3. Scenarios**

| Scenario                                               | BuildConfig exists? | DeploymentConfig exists? | Notes                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| App built from **GitHub repo using S2I**               | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                    | BC builds the image, DC deploys it                 |
| App built from **Dockerfile in OpenShift**             | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes                    | Similar to above, BC builds image, DC deploys pods |
| App deployed from **external image (DockerHub, Quay)** | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                    | No build happens inside OpenShift, only deployment |
| App deployed via **template** with prebuilt image      | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes                    | Only DeploymentConfig + optional ImageStream       |

## **4. Commands to see them**

* **BuildConfig**

```bash
oc get bc
oc describe bc <app-name>
```

* **DeploymentConfig**

```bash
oc get dc
oc describe dc <app-name>
```

* **ImageStream**

```bash
oc get is
oc describe is <image-stream-name>
```

---

## **5. Typical workflow**

1. **BuildConfig**: Pulls source code → builds image → pushes to OpenShift registry.
2. **ImageStream**: Tracks the image and its tags/digest.
3. **DeploymentConfig**: Watches ImageStream (ImageChange trigger) → deploys new pods when image changes.

---

✅ **Key takeaway**

* **BC is about building images**.
* **DC is about running pods**.
* You **see both only** if the app is **built inside OpenShift**.
* If you deploy a prebuilt image directly, you **only see DC (and optionally IS)**.

If you want, I can make a **diagram showing BuildConfig → ImageStream → DeploymentConfig → Pods** with both internal builds and external image deployments, so you can visualize when BC exists and when it doesn’t.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
