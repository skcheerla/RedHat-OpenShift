Got it 👍 Let’s go step by step. You want to **create a StorageClass with AWS in Red Hat OpenShift** using Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (OCS / ODF).

---

## 🔹 What is a StorageClass?

* In Kubernetes/OpenShift, a **StorageClass** defines **how persistent volumes (PVs) are provisioned** dynamically.
* On AWS, the StorageClass usually provisions **EBS (Elastic Block Store)** volumes for pods.

---

## 🔹 Pre-requisites

1. An OpenShift cluster running on **AWS**.
2. The **cluster has the AWS cloud provider configured** (so it can talk to EBS).
3. You should have the required permissions to create storage resources.

---

## 🔹 Steps to Create a StorageClass for AWS EBS in OpenShift

### 1. Verify available StorageClasses

Run:

```bash
oc get storageclass
```

👉 You might already see AWS-related classes like:

* `gp2` (General Purpose SSD)
* `gp3` (Newer generation SSD)
* `io1` (Provisioned IOPS SSD)

---

### 2. Create a StorageClass YAML

Example: StorageClass for **gp3 (recommended)**

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: gp3-storage
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  type: gp3
  fsType: ext4
reclaimPolicy: Delete
allowVolumeExpansion: true
volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
```

📌 Explanation:

* `provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs` → tells OpenShift to use AWS EBS.
* `type: gp3` → AWS EBS volume type.
* `fsType: ext4` → default filesystem inside the PV.
* `reclaimPolicy: Delete` → deletes EBS volume when PVC is deleted.
* `allowVolumeExpansion: true` → lets you resize volumes later.
* `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer` → volume will only be created in the same AZ as the pod.

---

### 3. Apply the StorageClass

Save the above file as `gp3-storageclass.yaml` and run:

```bash
oc apply -f gp3-storageclass.yaml
```

---

### 4. Set as Default StorageClass (Optional)

If you want this to be the **default** StorageClass:

```bash
oc patch storageclass gp3-storage -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
```

---

### 5. Test with a PVC

Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: test-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: gp3-storage
```

Apply:

```bash
oc apply -f pvc-test.yaml
```

Check:

```bash
oc get pvc test-pvc
oc get pv
```

👉 You should see an AWS EBS volume dynamically created and bound to the PVC.

---

✅ Now you have an AWS-backed StorageClass in OpenShift!

Do you want me to also show you **how this integrates with OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF/OCS)** (where it uses AWS S3 + EBS + EC2 instances for storage), or just the **native AWS EBS dynamic provisioning** is enough?
