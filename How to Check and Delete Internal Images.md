OpenShift does not support manually deleting images from the internal registry using a direct command like `oc rmi` or `oc delete image` for a specific image hash. The **only supported and safe method** for deleting images is through the **pruning process**.

The reason for this is that images and their layers in the registry are often shared among multiple projects and image streams. Manually deleting a single image could break other image streams or applications, leading to a corrupt state.

### The Correct Way to Delete Images

To manually initiate the deletion of unreferenced images, you must use the `oc adm prune images` command with the `--confirm` flag. This command is the official tool for cleaning up the registry and is designed to handle all the necessary checks to prevent data corruption.

Here's the process:

1.  **List Images to be Deleted (Dry Run):**
    First, verify which images would be deleted using a dry run. This is the same command you used before, as it's the intended way to preview the changes.

    ```bash
    oc adm prune images --keep-tag-revisions=0 --keep-younger-than=0m
    ```

    This command will list all the images and layers that are not currently referenced by any image stream or active workload. This step is crucial for verifying that you aren't about to delete anything you need.

2.  **Confirm the Deletion:**
    Once you've reviewed the list and are confident that you want to proceed, add the `--confirm` flag to the command.

    ```bash
    oc adm prune images --keep-tag-revisions=0 --keep-younger-than=0m --confirm
    ```

    This command will now execute the pruning process, physically deleting the unreferenced image data from the internal registry's storage. It will also clean up the associated metadata in the etcd database.

This process ensures that you don't accidentally break any dependencies and that the registry remains in a consistent state.
