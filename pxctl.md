Good catch üëç ‚Äî you won‚Äôt see `/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl` on a normal OpenShift node or your workstation.
That binary lives **inside the Portworx container** (because Portworx runs as a DaemonSet on worker nodes).

Here‚Äôs how you can access it:

---

### üîπ Step 1: Find a Portworx pod

Portworx pods usually run in the `kube-system` or `portworx` namespace. Run:

```bash
oc get pods -A | grep portworx
```

You should see something like:

```
kube-system   portworx-abc123   1/1   Running   10m
kube-system   portworx-def456   1/1   Running   10m
```

---

### üîπ Step 2: Exec into a Portworx pod

Pick one pod and run:

```bash
oc exec -it -n kube-system portworx-abc123 -- /bin/sh
```

---

### üîπ Step 3: Run `pxctl` inside the pod

Once inside, the `pxctl` binary is already on the path, so just run:

```bash
pxctl status
```

Example output:

```
Cluster ID: 1234abcd
Status: OK
Nodes: 3
   IP         ID      Used   Capacity   Status
   10.0.0.5   node1   200G   500G       Online
   10.0.0.6   node2   150G   500G       Online
   10.0.0.7   node3   100G   500G       Online

Cluster-wide Storage
   Total Capacity : 1500 GB
   Used           : 450 GB
   Available      : 1050 GB
```

---

‚úÖ If you don‚Äôt want to exec into pods every time:
Portworx also provides a **kubectl/oc plugin** called `pxctl` (sometimes installed separately), but in most OpenShift clusters the standard way is **exec into a Portworx pod** and run it there.

---

Do you want me to also give you a **pure OpenShift way** (using `oc describe storagecluster` or `oc get pxstoragecluster` CRD) so you can check capacity without entering the pod?


Excellent question üëå ‚Äî let‚Äôs break it down step by step:

---

## üîπ Where does Portworx capacity come from?

* Yes ‚úÖ, the **capacity you see in `pxctl status`** is based on the **raw block devices (disks) attached to each node** in your OpenShift cluster.
* When you install Portworx, you tell it **which disks to use** (for example `/dev/sdb`, `/dev/nvme1n1`, etc.).
* Portworx then **claims** these disks and manages them as **storage pools**.

---

## üîπ How Portworx consumes the raw disks

1. **Disk Pooling**

   * On each node, Portworx aggregates one or more raw disks into a **storage pool**.
   * Example:

     * Node1 has `/dev/sdb` (500 GB)
     * Node2 has `/dev/sdb` (500 GB)
     * Node3 has `/dev/sdb` (500 GB)
       ‚Üí Portworx builds a **500 GB pool per node** and then forms a **cluster-wide pool (1500 GB)**.

2. **Abstraction**

   * Applications don‚Äôt access raw disks directly.
   * Instead, they request **PVCs (Persistent Volume Claims)** in OpenShift.
   * Portworx dynamically provisions PVs from its storage pool.

3. **Replication & Fault Tolerance**

   * If you request a volume with replication (e.g. `repl=3`), Portworx will store **3 copies of the data** across 3 different nodes.
   * That means although raw disk shows 1500 GB, your **usable storage** depends on the replication factor.

     * With `repl=3`, 1500 GB raw ‚Üí ~500 GB usable.
     * With `repl=2`, 1500 GB raw ‚Üí ~750 GB usable.

4. **Features**

   * Thin provisioning: Volumes are allocated on-demand, not fully reserved.
   * Snapshots, encryption, and tiering are supported, all from the same raw disk pools.

---

## üîπ To check raw vs Portworx pools

Inside a Portworx pod:

```bash
pxctl cluster list             # Shows raw disk pools and capacities per node
pxctl storage pool show        # Details of each pool (raw disks inside)
```

Example:

```
Pool ID  Node   Disks         Size   Used
1        node1  /dev/sdb      500G   100G
2        node2  /dev/sdb      500G   120G
3        node3  /dev/sdb      500G   80G
```

---

‚úÖ **Summary**:

* Capacity comes from **raw disks attached to nodes**.
* Portworx **consumes entire raw block devices**, builds **storage pools**, and manages replication, thin provisioning, and volume lifecycle.
* The **usable capacity** depends on replication and pool configuration, not just the raw sum of disks.

---

Do you want me to also explain how you can **see which raw disks Portworx is using in your cluster** (via CRDs like `StorageCluster` and `pxctl`)?
