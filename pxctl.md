To find a Portworx daemonset pod:

oc -n portworx get pods -l name=portworx

login to the pod like below

oc exec -it -n portworx px-cluster-38bfc7c4-8hjjhvbhjvjhvjhvjhv-bq2fl -- /bin/sh

sh-5.1# pxctl status
Status: PX is operational

#pxctl service pool show

 Size: 2.0 TiB
        Status: Online
        Has metadata:  Yes
        Drives:
        1: /dev/mapper/mpathbj, Total size 2.0 TiB, Online
        Cache Drives:
        No Cache drives found in this pool



        StorageClasses Are Just Policy Templates

Kubernetes StorageClasses in Portworx don‚Äôt define storage capacity limits. They define:

Replication factors

Encryption settings

Snapshot policies

Shared volume support

Volume size settings (defaults)

File system type (fs)

IO profile (io_profile)

etc.

They do not carve out dedicated quotas or slices of total storage.



üìå Example:

If a Portworx node has 1 TB of available storage, then:

Volumes created via px-csi-db

Volumes created via px-csi-replicated

Volumes created via px-csi-db-encrypted

‚Ä¶will all consume storage from that same 1 TB pool ‚Äî based on the volume size requested by the PVC.




























Good catch üëç ‚Äî you won‚Äôt see `/opt/pwx/bin/pxctl` on a normal OpenShift node or your workstation.
That binary lives **inside the Portworx container** (because Portworx runs as a DaemonSet on worker nodes).

Here‚Äôs how you can access it:

---

### üîπ Step 1: Find a Portworx pod

Portworx pods usually run in the `kube-system` or `portworx` namespace. Run:

```bash
oc get pods -A | grep portworx
```

You should see something like:

```
kube-system   portworx-abc123   1/1   Running   10m
kube-system   portworx-def456   1/1   Running   10m
```

---

### üîπ Step 2: Exec into a Portworx pod

Pick one pod and run:

```bash
oc exec -it -n kube-system portworx-abc123 -- /bin/sh
```

---

### üîπ Step 3: Run `pxctl` inside the pod

Once inside, the `pxctl` binary is already on the path, so just run:

```bash
pxctl status
```

Example output:

```
Cluster ID: 1234abcd
Status: OK
Nodes: 3
   IP         ID      Used   Capacity   Status
   10.0.0.5   node1   200G   500G       Online
   10.0.0.6   node2   150G   500G       Online
   10.0.0.7   node3   100G   500G       Online

Cluster-wide Storage
   Total Capacity : 1500 GB
   Used           : 450 GB
   Available      : 1050 GB
```

---

‚úÖ If you don‚Äôt want to exec into pods every time:
Portworx also provides a **kubectl/oc plugin** called `pxctl` (sometimes installed separately), but in most OpenShift clusters the standard way is **exec into a Portworx pod** and run it there.

---

Do you want me to also give you a **pure OpenShift way** (using `oc describe storagecluster` or `oc get pxstoragecluster` CRD) so you can check capacity without entering the pod?
