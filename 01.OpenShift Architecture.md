Red Hat OpenShift is an enterprise-grade, hybrid cloud platform built on Kubernetes. It provides a comprehensive solution for developing, deploying, and managing containerized applications. While it uses Kubernetes for orchestration, it adds a layer of tools and features that simplify and enhance the platform for both developers and IT operations teams.

The core architecture of OpenShift is composed of a cluster of machines, which are divided into two primary types of nodes:

* **Control Plane Nodes (formerly "Master Nodes"):** These nodes form the "brain" of the cluster. They manage the state of the cluster, handle API requests, and schedule pods on the worker nodes. Key components on the control plane include:
    * **API Server:** The main entry point for all cluster management requests.
    * **etcd:** A distributed key-value store that holds all the cluster data.
    * **Scheduler:** Responsible for assigning pods to the appropriate worker nodes.
    * **Controller Manager:** A continuously running loop that watches the cluster's state and takes action to bring it to the desired state.
* **Worker Nodes:** These are the machines where the actual containerized applications run. Each worker node has a Kubelet service that communicates with the control plane and a container runtime (like CRI-O) to manage the containers.

OpenShift also includes a variety of additional components and services that provide a complete application platform, such as:

* **Operators:** A key feature of OpenShift, Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes-native applications. They automate common tasks and lifecycle management for complex applications.
* **Integrated Container Registry:** A built-in registry for storing and managing container images.
* **Networking:** OpenShift provides software-defined networking (SDN) for communication between pods and services, and a built-in router for external traffic.
* **Security:** OpenShift offers a strong security model with features like Security Context Constraints (SCCs), role-based access control (RBAC), and automated container scanning.
* **Developer and Administrator Tools:** A web console and command-line interface (CLI) provide a user-friendly way to manage the platform and applications.
