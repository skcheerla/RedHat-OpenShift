IN simple terms 

. User submits a request

You (or a system) create a pod (or deployment) by sending a request to the Kubernetes API Server.

This request is like: "Hey, I want to run this app."

2. API Server checks everything

The API server:

Authenticates you (checks who you are).

Authorizes you (checks if you are allowed to create this pod).

Checks if there are enough resources available (CPU, memory limits).

Applies security rules and policies.

Injects default settings like secrets, service accounts, node selectors.

Once everything is good, it saves the pod data in etcd (Kubernetes' database).

3. Controllers watch and act

Various controllers watch the pod info stored in etcd:

Deployment controller ensures the desired number of pods are running.

Service Account controller manages access and secrets.

Persistent Volume controller handles storage.

Others manage storage attachment, routing, images, etc.

Controllers constantly check and try to make reality match what you requested.

4. Scheduler picks a node

The scheduler sees new pods that need a place to run.

It checks nodes to find the best fit based on:

Available resources (CPU, memory).

Node taints and pod tolerations.

Affinity (rules about which nodes pods prefer).

Scheduler assigns the pod to a specific node and updates pod info.

5. Kubelet on the node takes over

Each worker node runs a kubelet agent.

Kubelet watches the API server for pods assigned to its node.

It validates pod specs, checks security policies.

Ensures volumes are attached.

Pulls container images (via container runtimes like CRI-O or containerd).

Starts the container(s).

6. Networking and IP allocation

The pod gets an IP address.

Kubernetes sets up routing rules so pods can talk to each other and outside world.

Services and ingress controllers manage how traffic flows to pods.

7. Pod readiness and health checks

Kubelet runs readiness probes (checks if pod is ready to serve traffic).

Runs liveness probes (checks if pod is alive).

When ready, kubelet updates pod status to API server.

Services start sending traffic to ready pods.

8. Pod lifecycle status updates

Pod status is continuously updated and stored in etcd.

Controllers and kubelet react to status changes (restart pods if needed).


Extra concepts:

Taints and tolerations: Nodes can be "tainted" to repel pods unless those pods "tolerate" the taint.

Security Context Constraints (SCC): Rules about what pods are allowed to do.



**Summary (super short):**

You ask Kubernetes to create a pod.

API server validates and saves pod info.

Controllers manage pod objects.

Scheduler picks the best node.

Kubelet on that node runs the pod.

Networking connects the pod.

Health checks run and update status.

Kubernetes manages the pod until deleted.


*********************************************************************************




oc new-app
client submits higher levelobject

this request goes to like below

Kube API server

 -he will authenticate and check his authorization

he ll check resource quota, scc, image policies,image singature checks , service accont injection
node selector, namespace selector ,default mutations and image pull secrets


persist final pod object to etcd



etcd 

stores the pod object in cluster state
any controller or kubelet reads etcd via apiserver


controllers 

replication controller -- if deployement mentioned replica
deployement controller -- create pod objects wen create a deployement
service account controller --- maintains & secrets fr svc accounts
pvc controller   - handling binding and provisioning operations (pv/pvs)

attach and detach controller for block storage 
openshift controller -- imagestram controllers , route controllers, service controllers

All these controllers hhelp to reconsile respective pods based on the request


even though
Pod is unscheduled

scheduler 

scheduler component comes into picture

watches fr pods with specific node names
runs predicates and scoring - based on node capacity,node taint, affinity
topology constraint, etc and choose the bestnode and writes binding to the pod object via api servers

controlplane 

controlplane updates & all controllers react
deployement controller node pod is scheduled
end point controller will later update service updates
images stream controller reacts if openshift imagestream is called

Node is decided


Kubelet


then each worker node has kublet

kubelet watches api server for pod object assigned to node

validates pod specifications locally security constriants ,cgroups

ensures volumes pvcs are attached and mounted

pulls container images via container run time (crio)

crio

pull images from registry
create containers namespaces ,secrets contexts,cgroups
it start the process inside the container

 

Popular Container Runtimes

Runtime	         Used By	                Notes
runc	       Low-level runtime	     Actually runs containers via Linux
Docker	       Legacy/runtime tool	     Uses runc under the hood
containerd	   Kubernetes, Docker	     Lightweight, CRI-compatible
CRI-O	       OpenShift, Kubernetes   	Built for Kubernetes 



Networking OVN kubernetes

it is equivalent kubeproxy
- allocates pod ips and program node networking
routing rules ip allocation to pod,nodeport
ensures service connectivity and netwkr policy is enforced

Networking integreates with routes/ingress for external access



pod lifecycle

kubelet runs readiness and liveness  probes
when readiness probe succeceeds pods bcmes ready and service endpoints updates
kubelets updates podstatus back to api server


API server will update /etcd with the pod status



SCC

taint  -given to a node
tolerate - tolerate given to a pod

tolerate will take preceedance and stil can run on a tainted node


Nice — here’s a clear, step-by-step backend walkthrough of **what happens when a Pod is created in OpenShift (4.x)** and what each major component does. I’ll cover both the control-plane flow (API/server, controllers, scheduler, etcd) and the node-side flow (kubelet, container runtime, CNI, CSI), plus OpenShift-specific extras (openshift-apiserver, SCCs, ImageStreams). I’ll also give you practical `oc` commands to watch the flow in a real cluster.

---

# 1) Client submits a Pod (or higher-level object)

You create a Pod (or a Deployment/DeploymentConfig/ReplicaSet which in turn requests Pods) via `oc apply` / `oc create` / a controller.

Example:

```bash
oc apply -f pod.yaml
# or oc create deployment myapp --image=... 
```

---

# 2) API server(s) — the front door

**Components:** `kube-apiserver` (Kubernetes), `openshift-apiserver` (OpenShift extensions)

**What they do:**

* **Authenticate** the request (OAuth tokens, client certs).
* **Authorize** (RBAC, ABAC) to check if requester can create Pods.
* **Admission controllers** run (mutating then validating). OpenShift runs extra admission plugins such as:

  * **SecurityContextConstraints (SCC)** — enforces pod security contexts/allowed uids.
  * **Image policy / image signature checks** and service account injection.
  * **ResourceQuota**, `LimitRanger`, `Namespace`/Project enforcement, `NodeSelector` defaulting, etc.
* **Defaulting & mutation**: injects `serviceAccount`, image pull secrets, default resources, annotations.
* **Persist** the final Pod object to **etcd**.

**How to observe:**

```bash
oc get pods -o yaml
oc get events --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
```

---

# 3) etcd — the source of truth

**What it does:**

* Stores the Pod object (and all cluster state). Any controller or kubelet reads/watches etcd via the API server.

---

# 4) Controllers (kube-controller-manager and OpenShift controllers)

**Which controllers matter:**

* **ReplicaSet / Deployment controller** (creates Pod objects when you create a Deployment).
* **ReplicationController** (if DCs used), **DeploymentConfig controller** (legacy OpenShift DCs).
* **ServiceAccount controller** (creates secrets for service accounts).
* **PersistentVolume / PVC controllers** (handle binding/provisioning).
* **Attach/Detach controllers** (for block devices).
* OpenShift controllers (image stream controllers, route controller, etc.)

**What they do:**

* Reconcile desired state → create Pod objects (if you used a Deployment).
* When a PVC is requested, controller either binds to a matching PV or triggers dynamic provisioner (CSI/storageclass).

**Observe controllers:**

```bash
oc get deployment,myapp -o yaml   # shows ReplicaSet created and expected replicas
oc get rs
oc get pvc,pv
```

---

# 5) Pod is *unscheduled* — scheduler picks a node

**Component:** `kube-scheduler`

**What it does:**

* Watches for Pods with `spec.nodeName == ""` (unscheduled).
* Runs predicates & scoring: node capacity, resource requests, taints & tolerations, nodeAffinity, PodAffinity/AntiAffinity, topology constraints (zone), Storage locality (volumeBindingMode WaitForFirstConsumer).
* Chooses the best node and **writes a Binding** (or updates `spec.nodeName`) to the Pod object via the API server.

**Observe assignment:**

```bash
oc get pod mypod -o yaml | grep nodeName -A2
# or watch scheduler events
oc get events --field-selector reason=Scheduled
```

---

# 6) Control-plane updates and controllers react

* The **ReplicaSet/Deployment controller** notes the Pod is scheduled.
* **Endpoint controller** will later update Service endpoints when Pod becomes Ready.
* **ImageStream / ImageChange** controllers may react if image references are OpenShift ImageStreams.

---

# 7) Node side — kubelet sees the scheduled pod

**Component:** `kubelet` (runs on the chosen node)

**What it does:**

* Watches API server for Pod objects assigned to the node (via watches/informers).
* Validates the pod spec locally (security constraints, cgroups).
* Ensures volumes (PVCs) are attached / mounted:

  * If CSI driver needed, `csi-attacher`/external components attach the block device and kubelet mounts it.
  * For local PVs nodeAffinity ensures pod is placed on the correct node.
* Pulls container images via the container runtime (CRI-O in OpenShift).

  * Uses image pull secrets injected by admission.
  * OpenShift image policy may rewrite image references (ImageStream integrations).

**Observe kubelet actions:**

```bash
oc describe pod mypod
# look at Events: pulling image, Created, Started, MountVolume, etc.
```

---

# 8) Container runtime creates containers

**Component:** CRI runtime on node (OpenShift uses **CRI-O** or **containerd**)

**What it does:**

* Pulls image layers from registry (internal image registry or external).
* Creates container(s) with correct namespaces, cgroups, security context (SELinux labels, seccomp).
* Starts process inside the container.

**Observe** start times and container logs:

```bash
oc logs mypod -c mycontainer
```

---

# 9) CNI plugin configures networking

**Component(s):** OpenShift SDN or **OVN-Kubernetes** (CNI plugin), kube-proxy or its equivalent

**What they do:**

* Allocate Pod IP and program node networking (routing rules / iptables / OVN logical network).
* Ensure service connectivity (ClusterIP, NodePort) and network policies enforced.
* For OpenShift, the networking integrates with Routes/Ingress for external access.

**Observe networking:**

```bash
oc get pods -o wide   # shows pod IP and node
oc get svc            # services and cluster IPs
```

---

# 10) Pod lifecycle: Ready, Liveness, Readiness

* kubelet runs **readiness** and **liveness** probes.
* When readiness probe succeeds the Pod becomes **Ready** → Service endpoints updated.
* kubelet updates Pod **status** back to API server (phase: Pending → Running, conditions).

**Observe status:**

```bash
oc get pod mypod
oc describe pod mypod   # check Conditions and Events
```

---

# 11) Volume cleanup, termination and reconciliation

* If you delete the Pod, kubelet tells the container runtime to stop containers, unmount volumes.
* Controller sees fewer replicas and will recreate Pods if desired (ReplicaSet).
* PV reclaimPolicy controls PV fate (Retain, Delete, Recycle).

---

# OpenShift-specific extras to know

* **openshift-apiserver**: handles OpenShift API objects (ImageStreams, Routes, BuildConfigs). Admission controllers here can mutate/check objects.
* **SecurityContextConstraints (SCC)**: OpenShift’s mechanism to control allowed security contexts for pods (UID ranges, privileged, etc.).
* **ImageStream & internal image registry**: OpenShift can rewrite image references and provide internal registry; ImageStream controllers keep track of digests.
* **Operators**: image-registry-operator, cluster-version-operator, local-storage-operator — they watch and reconcile cluster state and may react to Pod-related changes (e.g., attach registry PVC).
* **Service Accounts & Secrets**: service account controller creates pull secrets and mounts them into Pods.

---

# Quick checklist — useful commands to trace a Pod creation end-to-end

```bash
# 1. Create/Apply
oc apply -f pod.yaml

# 2. See the Pod and which node it lands on
oc get pod mypod -o wide

# 3. See detailed state & events
oc describe pod mypod

# 4. Watch events as it moves through phases
oc get events -w

# 5. Inspect logs from containers
oc logs mypod

# 6. Check PVC/PV status if volumes involved
oc get pvc
oc get pv

# 7. Inspect image pull/source
oc get pod mypod -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[*].image}'
```

---

# Short summary (one-line)

1. Client → API server (authz, admission) → etcd persists Pod.
2. Controllers create/observe objects; Scheduler assigns a node.
3. kubelet on the node pulls image, mounts volumes, calls container runtime to start containers; CNI wires networking.
4. kubelet reports status back; readiness/liveness probes and controllers finalize desired state.
   OpenShift layers in `openshift-apiserver`, SCC, ImageStreams, and Operators that extend and enforce policies during the above flow.

---

If you want, I can:

* draw a visual diagram of this flow, or
* produce a concrete trace (commands + expected output) for a sample Pod to run in your 4.11 cluster so you can watch every step live. Which would you prefer?
